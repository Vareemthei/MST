# MST
This was a school project to create a Minimum Spanning Tree using Prim's algorithm. The program takes in a text file with a list of edges and their weights and outputs the edges that make up the MST and the total weight of the MST. The graphs were undirected and weighted.

## Usage
The text file should be formatted as follows:

```
<Number of Vertices (Max)>

<Source Node> <Destination Node> <Weight>
<Source Node> <Destination Node> <Weight>
...
```
